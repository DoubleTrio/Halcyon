V 0.3.0,
Initial public demo release. 



V 0.4.0
- Added two mods you can enable on top of Halcyon! Know that they are not compatible with each other right now due to technical limitations. If you want both, simply use all starters when you start a new game, then toggle it off and toggle no nicknames on as soon as you can save your game.
  To use these mods, drag the folder of the mod in the Halcyon Mods folder into the overal PMDO mods folder, then activate the mod on the main menu under Mods.
  - No nicknames: Changes the names of NPCs to their species names, for people who prefer that over the custom names they had.
  - All Starters: Allows you to pick ANY pokemon as a starter and partner! Allows more customization options as well with regards to egg moves and abilities.
		  Please note that if there are no sprites for that Pokemon, they can't be selected.
		  Please also note that this may cause certain cutscenes to look strange if the Pokemon chosen as a starter/partner lacks an animation.
		  Furthermore, this mod may be a bit buggy; please report any issues with starter pokemon to Palika.
- Improved outlaw spawning code from Trio-
- Fixed Domi Blend displaying a belly fill message (it should do that silently)
- Fixed Apple Cider NOT displaying a belly fill message (it should say your belly was filled)
- Added a new UI to the cafe drink system that should be much more convenient for players.
- Added a new drink to the cafe that unlocks in Chapter 4. Endurance Tonic costs a Reviver Seed and a Chesto Berry and gives the consumer 5 turns of Endure status, preventing their HP from going below 1. Unlike the usual endure effect given by the move, this one is not cleared by moving.
- Two new training mazes unlock in Chapter 4, Flying and Rock.
- Lars will now sell colored and plain Apricorns once Chapter 4 starts. He'll sell one guaranteed a day. 
- Rhizo will also have a chance to sell plain and colored Apricorns once Chapter 4 starts.
- Fixed Water Maze's element being Fire and not Water.
- Espurr, Meowth-A, Popplio, Charcadet, Tepig, and Zorua-H are added as starters. Check pokemon changes file to see some changes to Espurr's and Charcadet's level up table, as well as the changes to Zorua-H.
- Fixed a bug where a client pokemon with temporary water privileges (i.e. water sport) being beamed out while on water caused an error.
- Adjusted logic for turning towards a specified location, this should make certain scripted character turns better at looking in the proper direction when turning to look at a location.
- Fixed a number of minor typos.
- Time Gear Remix has been replaced with an original composition by Minemaker0430. Thank you again!
- Hunger seeds in Crooked Cavern have been replaced with Decoy seeds. These should help with the unique challenges that dungeon provides.
- Slightly reduced the first boss leader's stats.
- Significantly reduced a certain Hypnosis user's Speed stat. This will make her more likely to miss her Hypnosis as well as easier to land attacks on.
- Adjusted a certain moron's stat EVs. This ends up giving him less Atk and Sp. Atk, but more Speed, Def. and Sp. Def.
- Changed some starter movesets around a bit to allow certain mons to get STAB moves earlier on. Check pokemon changes file for details.
- Added a QoL message that warns you when leaving a floor with an incomplete job.
- Improve Fleeing Outlaw AI to be less cheesable.
- The range at which certain enemies are allowed to use moves from has been reduced. This should prevent unfair sniping from certain enemies early on in the game.
- Added scarf sprites for Mudkip. It seems I had accidentially passed over him when I first added all the scarf pokemon I had sprites for.
- Added certain actions that happen mid sentence, now that the [script] tag is available. This has been added throughout the game here and there, where appropriate. Typically used to have a character hop at the end of a sentence.
- Added plot-based goals to Mission Objectives, ala Explorers. If you're in the current story dungeon, Mission Objectives now has a non-generic line telling you what the objective is instead of just "Go as far as you can."
- Power Band, Def. Scarf, Special Band, and Zinc Band all boost their respective stat by 20% now instead of 10%.
- Fixed a bug where Exploration missions didn't have their difficulty increased.
- Lowered base price of Stayaway Orb from 150 to 50.
- Nerfed gummi spawn rates in shops, the cafe, and mission rewards by about half. Dungeon rates are unchanged, but may be adjusted in the future.
- Added the ability to eat gummis and stat boosters in the overworld (thank you Trio-)
- Added a new Adventuring Tip to Almotz's almanac.
- Revamped internal logic for Cafe Specials and added a more updated system for determining which item to pick.
- Fixed a display bug in the pokemon's info menu when a scarf sprite was being used.
- Fixed Kecleon's not leaning over their counter when talking to them.
- Fixed fail result in Relic Forest not giving a results screen.
- Added a Store All option to Kanga in town. This option won't store your equipped items, be aware.
- Fixed a display bug for Apple Cider in the ferment prompt.
- Fixed a bug where outlaws would spawn with no moves.
- Fixed cheri bombs not working due to a PMDO issue.
- Tweaked some wording in the cafe to prevent an issue where you'd get "a (vowel)" on fermented item get.
- Fixed an issue where finishing/losing in Ledian Dojo would cause the ground to not setup in the same way that it would had you entered in the map from the ladder.
- Fixed an issue where generic win/lose scenes in Ledian Dojo would cause background NPCs to not animate correctly. 
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't store items at Kanga if the only items you had were equipped to someone.
- Fixed a bug where losing in Relic Forest Round 2 would skip you to the last floor of the backtrack.
- Fixed a bug where an invalid item type was trying to be rewarded (golden spike instead of golden thorn)
- Fixed an issue where pokemon that spawn past the initial set on a MH outlaw floor would be marked as a goon.
- Adjusted the logic for outlaw moveset; they now have 4 random moves they can know at that level, minus any moves that are blacklisted (teleport, OHKO moves, etc.)



V0.5.0
-Added Bandana portraits and sprites for Tepig and Snivy. Thank you to 3P1C for making them!
-Cafe special and the merchants now have a custom menu that gives info on what you're buying before you buy it. Thank you to MistressNebula for making it!
-Mido can now sell Flame and Toxic orbs.
-Illuminant Riverbed has had its generation updated a bit to make it look more like a river is flowing through it. Thank you Touhou Project for the update!
-Illuminant Riverbed now has you skipping across rocks to cross the river. Thank you Touhou Project for the update!
-All Starters mod now has a wonderful UI for selecting your hero/partner created by MistressNebula!
-All Starters can now be enabled alongside No Nicknames.
	-Note: If you already have All Starters or No Nicknames installed in your mod folder, delete their folders and then reinstall with the new versions in the Halcyon Mods folder.
-Added Quick seed. It temporarily boosts movement speed (as you would expect).
-Metano Town Kecleon shop now sells Quick seeds, Slow Orbs, and Gravelerocks.
-Some general item prices like seeds have been adjusted slightly. Adjusted the prices of TMs to better correlate to how good the TM is. Orbs have been scaled a bit differently, typically to be cheaper.
-Fixed a bug with the Store All option for Auntie Kanga where stackable items would get duped and cause items appearing after them in the bag to not get stored
-Fixed a bug with Dion that caused him to not take the right number of sticks from you if the sticks were across multiple stacks and you had just enough sticks to make a Domi Blend.
-Fixed a bug similar to the two above that occurs when the game would want to send a stackable item you've equipped to storage (for example, entering a dojo maze).
-Fixed a bug where selling stackables to the Kecleon Shop would only remove 1 in the stack instead of deleting the entire stack properly. These stackable bugs were all caused by a PMDO update changing how the remove player bag/equipped item commands worked, so it's possible you weren't encountering them during your playthrough.
-Reviver seeds no longer ask if you want to use them and are now automatically used instead.
-Fixed bad sorting on items that were edited from base PMDO (typically to change their price). Let me know if any items still sort strangely.
-Some dialogue regarding the player's strange feeling has been edited slightly to better illustrate how that feeling feels.
-snorlax passerby has been changed to Makuhita.
-Yamper now has Ball Fetch instead of Static as Ball Fetch now works properly.
-Fixed a number of minor typos.
-Updated the "Where would you like to explore?" dungeon choice menu. Resembles Sky's a bit more now, and is compatible with more recent PMDO versions.
-Updated Gummis to better reflect new Vanilla PMDO behavior. Check Almotz's almanac for information! New behavior should allow for a more even distribution of stat boosts. They're a tad stronger at boosting than in base PMDO, however.
-Updated Vitamins to reflect new Vanilla PMDO behavior. This means their boost is slightly stronger than before.
-Update Ezalor's info blurb to better reflect that he can reteach you ANY move you've forgotten, not just level-up moves.
-Cafe items can no longer be eaten by Pluck, Gluttony's stealing effect, Bug Bite, etc.
-Some pre-existing scenes have been cleaned up a little in terms of choreography (how the characters move, turn, timings of these, etc.) to improve the scene's look.
-Updated the description of the Synergy Scarves to be a bit more clear on their main effect.
-Fixed Team Style having less HP than they should due to a PMDO update reducing the effectiveness of hidden EVs.
-Replaced Stunky in Crooked Cavern with Purrloin. Avoids an issue with Stunky being a town mon, and also avoids an issue with aftermath breaking your items after defeating stunky to get your item back.
-Partner's name now stays yellow instead of turning dark blue while alone in Relic Forest during the opening.
-Improved partner following AI in the overworld.
-Updated head shaking function to be more like Explorer's (the head shake has less turn frames, but does one more turn iteration than explorer's.)
-Tuned up all cutscenes to improve the choreography a little bit here and there.
-Removed a reference to the partner hatching from Chapter 1. 
-Fixed a bug where Chapter 2's very first cutscene would play again if you saved the game and then quit without leaving the room to see the next cutscene.
-Increased experience gain in dojo training mazes by 25% to make them better grind spots.
-When the partner and an NPC overlap in the overworld, the NPC is now given priority when talking to the stack of them. This will help prevent talking to the partner when you mean to talk to an NPC.
