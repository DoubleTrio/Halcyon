-Make sure Audino fixes groundactionhop to have the waitframe at the peak of the jump.
-Slower walking speed updates now that it's possible in ch5 guild scene and ch5 boss first encounter
-Textbox fade outs on story deaths (audino must fix the current method for this)
-Fix Anima Core song so that it has the same minor delay before kicking in as all other songs do.
-Adjust music unlocking. Leave "innocent" songs unlocked by default, but custom or more serious songs can be unlocked later, when they play for the first time.
